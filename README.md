# Chicken Boolean
# **Project Description**
    To build a website that allows the user to view and save meal recipes.
## **User Story**

 - As the key decision maker when it comes to meal planning, I am looking for an application that I can search for different recipes based on key parameters and save those recipes for future use. 
 - When I enter the site, then I am greeted with a landing page that will allow me to sign into my account or create a new account.
 - When I choose to sign into my account, then I will be routed to a sign-in page where I will enter my username and password.
 - When my username and password are authenticated, then I will be redirected to the landing page where I can search for recipes
 - When I choose to create a new account from the landing page, then I am directed to a page to create a new account. 
 - When I have completed creating a new account, then I am routed back to the landing page where I can then sign into my account. 
 - When I enter keywords in the search field, then a list of recipes will populate based on the search parameters that I entered. 
 - When I see a recipe that I like, then I can click on a save button that will add the recipe to my dashboard. 
 - When I click on the link to the dashboard, then I am directed to a page that will show my saved recipes. 
 - When I click on a saved recipe, then the details of the saved recipe will appear. 
 - When I click on the logout link, then I will be logged out of my account and routed back to the landing page.`
